<!-- Static typing makes code written in TypeScript more predictable, 
and generally easier to debug. -->

<!-- Modules, namespaces and strong OOP support 
make it easier to organize the code base for very large and complicated apps. -->

<!-- A compilation step to JavaScript catches all 
kinds of errors before they reach runtime and cause errors. -->
